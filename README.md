Parts of Speech (POS) Tagger
Objective
This project aims to build an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to classify words in sentences into grammatical categories (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) while providing an intuitive explanation for each tag.

Project Description
What Has Been Developed:
An intelligent and interpretable Parts of Speech (POS) Tagger capable of tagging words in sentences accurately and explaining the reasoning behind the classification.

How It Was Built:
Data Preprocessing: Implemented tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction techniques.
Model Development: Used Machine Learning models (e.g., HMM, CRF) and Deep Learning architectures like BiLSTMs and Transformers (BERT).
Explainability: Incorporated linguistic rules and attention mechanisms for transparency in predictions.
Deployment: Developed a web-based interface using Flask/Streamlit for real-time tagging and explanation.
Why It Was Built:
To explore and apply advanced NLP and AI techniques, gain hands-on experience with sequence modeling, and develop practical tools for real-world linguistic challenges.

Applications in Society:
Grammar checkers and language learning tools.
Supporting linguistic research and automated text analysis.
Foundational tools for Generative AI systems.
Impacts:
Demonstrates the practical application of NLP and Machine Learning techniques.
Contributes to creating interpretable AI models that enhance transparency.
Builds a strong foundation for advanced projects in AI and NLP domains.
Features
Tokenizes and tags words with high accuracy using state-of-the-art NLP models.
Provides reasoning behind each tag for better interpretability.
User-friendly interface for testing and demonstration.
